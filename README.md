# üêà Felix

Felix is (not yet) an x86 operating system.<br>
It's **written completely from scratch** in Rust and Assembly and does't use any external dependecies.

## Compiling and debugging
(Only for Linux)

Make sure you have the Bochs emulator and Rust installed on your system.

Then run the debug script `./debug.sh`.

The script will take care of everything (compiling, making the image and running the debugger)

The Bochs emulator should start, press "continue" to cotinue with the execution.
