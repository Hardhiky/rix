## Description

Felix is my attempt at writing an x86 operating system.

It's **written completely from scratch** in Rust and doesn't use any external dependecies.

## Features

### Bootloader
 - boots (you don't say!)
 - BIOS compatible (also works on UEFI with CSM enabled)
 - Global Descriptor Table loading
 - Unreal Mode switching (to use 32bit addresses in 16bit Real Mode)
 - kernel copying from disk to protected memory
 - 32bit Protected Mode switching
 - kernel jumping

 ### Kernel
 - print macro able to write formatted text to VGA text buffer 
 - Interrupt Descriptor Table loading
 - handler for CPU exceptions
 - PIC driver that handles hardware interrupts

## Building

You can download a pre-built image or you can build it by yourself using Docker or the build script.

### Download pre-built image
[![build](https://github.com/mrgian/felix/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mrgian/felix/actions)

A build is made for every commit.

To download the latest build click on the badge above, then click on the most recent build and download the artifact.

### Build using Docker
First make sure you have Docker installed. Then:

1. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/mrgian/felix`
2. Change dir to repo `cd felix`
3. Build the image `docker build -t felix-image .`
4. Run the container `docker run --name felix-container felix-image`
5. Copy build from container to host `docker cp felix-container:/root/felix/build build`

### Build using script
Make sure you have `Rust`,`mtools`,`dosfstools` and `fdisk` installed on your system. Then:

1. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/mrgian/felix`
2. Change dir to repo `cd felix`
3. Run build script `./build.sh`

## Running
The final disk image is `build/disk.img`

You can run it in QEMU using this command: `qemu-system-i386 -drive id=disk,file=build/disk.img,if=none,format=raw -device ahci,id=ahci -device ide-hd,drive=disk,bus=ahci.0`

Or you can run it on a real x86 computer by copying the disk image to a USB drive using this command: `sudo dd if=build/disk.img of=/dev/sdX status=progress` and then booting from USB.
