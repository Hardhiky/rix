## Compiling and running
(Only for Linux)

Make sure you have BOCHS installed on your system.

Then just enter `./debug.sh` in a terminal.

The Bochs emulator should start, press "continue" to cotinue with the execution.

The script will take care of everything (assembling, making the image and running)
